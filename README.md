## Abstract

Interpreting what a deep learning model has learned is a challenging task. In this paper, we focus on exploring attention-based deep learning models in the domain of sentiment analysis. We present an architecture relying upon an attention mechanism. This paper presents the results of an exploratory evaluation of attention-based deep learning models on lexicons of affective words. Our findings suggest that word valence is not the most significant information. Obtained evaluation results lead to a conclusion that word valences do play a significant role in sentiment analysis, but possibly models rely upon other dimensions perhaps not distinguishable by humans.
